Answer A good’s price elasticity of demand ({ E_{d}}E_{d}, PED) is a measure of how sensitive the quantity demanded is to its price. It may also be defined as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in price of particular commodity. \\[ E_{\\langle p\\rangle}=\\frac{\\Delta Q / Q}{\\Delta P / P} \\] Q=expression(Q=650-5*P-P^2) The first derivative with refer to P, or dQ/dP D(Q, &#39;P&#39;) ## -(5 + 2 * P) The price elasticity of demand is (-(5 + 2 * P))*(P/Q) Since Q=650-5*P-P^2 When P is equal to 10, the price elasticity of demand is (-(5 + 2 * 10))*((650-5*10-10^2)/10) ## [1] -1250 Given that \\(TC=31+24 Q-5.5 Q^{2}+\\frac{1}{3} Q^{3}\\), where \\(T C\\) denotes total cost and \\(Q\\) denotes quantity sold, find the values of \\(Q\\) where the cost function reaches a minimum and a maximum. How can you verify if it is a minimum or a maximum? Find the total cost at the minimum and maximum points. Answer TC=expression(31+24*Q-5.5*Q^(2)+(1/3)*Q^(3)) The first derivative D(TC, &#39;Q&#39;) ## 24 - 5.5 * (Q^((2) - 1) * (2)) + (1/3) * (Q^((3) - 1) * (3)) The simplized form 24-11*Q+Q^2 When the first derivative is equal to 0: Q=3 or 8 The second derivative D(D(TC,&#39;Q&#39;),&#39;Q&#39;) ## (1/3) * (Q^(((3) - 1) - 1) * ((3) - 1) * (3)) - 5.5 * (Q^(((2) - ## 1) - 1) * ((2) - 1) * (2)) The simplified form -11+2Q When Q = 3: the second derivative (=-5) is less than 0; When Q = 8: the second derivative (=5) is greater than 0. According to the rule: The second derivative is positive (f (x) &gt; 0): When the second derivative is positive, the function f(x) is concave up. 2. The second derivative is negative (f (x) &lt; 0): When the second derivative is negative, the function f(x) is concave down. When Q = 3, the total cost should be the maximum, which is 31+24*3-5.5*3^(2)+(1/3)*3^(3) ## [1] 62.5 When Q = 8, the total cost should be the minimum, which is 31+24*8-5.5*8^(2)+(1/3)*8^(3) ## [1] 41.66667 A monopolist sells two products, \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), for which the demand functions are: \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;Q_{x}=25-0.5 P_{x} \\\\ &amp;Q_{y}=30-P_{y} \\end{aligned} \\] and the combined cost function is \\[ c=Q_{x}^{2}+2 Q_{x} Q_{y}+Q_{y}^{2}+20 \\] Find the following: the profit-maximizing level of output for each product the profit-maximizing price for each product, and the maximum profit. Answer Since profit=sales revenue-cost =Q*P-c, in this case, profit=PxQx+PyQy-cost =Qx(-2Qx+50)+Qy(-Qy+30)-(Qx2+2QxQy+Qy2+20) The first derivative with respect to Qx = (-6)Qx+40-2QY, the second derivative with refer to Qx = -6, which is less than 0. The first derivative with respect to QY = (-4)Qy+30-2Qx, the second derivative with refer to QY = -4, which is less than 0. Thus, the profit is maxium when the two equations are equal to 0. Then set the two equations to be equal to 0, and solve the two functions, we get Qx=7, and QY=4. Therefore, Px=36, PY=26, and the maximum profit = 7*(-2*7+50)+4*(-4+30)-(7^2+2*7*4+4^2+20) ## [1] 215 A manufacturer of parts for the tricycle industry sells three tires \\((x)\\) for every frame \\((y)\\). Thus, \\(\\frac{x}{3}=y\\) or \\(x=3 y\\). If the demand is \\[ \\begin{aligned} &amp;x=63-0.25 P_{x} \\\\ &amp;y=60-\\frac{1}{3} P_{y} \\end{aligned} \\] and costs are \\[ c=x^{2}+x y+y^{2}+190 \\] find the profit-maximizing level of (a) output, (b) price, and profit. Answer profit=Pxx+Pyy-cost =x((63-x)/0.25)+y((60-y)3)-(x^2+xy+y^2+190) Since x=3y, profit=3y((63-3y)/0.25)+y((60-y)3)-((3y)2+(3y)y+y2+190) The first derivative with respect to y = -104*y+816 Then set the equation to be equal to 0, we get y=7.846154, and x = 23.53846. Since the second derivative with respect to y(=-104) is less than 0, this set of x and y values ensures the maximum profit. We also get Px = 157.8462, Py=156.4615, and profit = 3952.769. Faced with two demand functions in two distinct markets \\[ Q_{1}=24-0.2 P_{1} \\text { and } Q_{2}=10-0.05 P_{2} \\] and a cost function where the relationship between costs and quantity sold in either market is \\(T C=35+40 Q\\), what prices will the firm charge (a) with price discrimination and (b) without price discrimination? Answer With price discrimination, the profit in market 1 = P1(24-0.2P1)-(35+40(24-0.2P1)) = -0.2P1^2+32P1-35-40*24 take the first derivative, and set it to 0, P1 = 80. With price discrimination, the profit in market 1 = P2(10-0.05P2)-(35+40(10-0.05P2)) = -0.05*P2^2+12P2-435 take the first derivative, and set it to 0, P2 = 120. Without price discrimination,P1 should be equal to P2, which is denoted as P. the total profit in market 1 and 2 = PQ1 + PQ2 - TC1 - TC2 = P(24-0.2P) + P(10-0.05P)-35-40(24-0.2P)-35-40(10-0.05P) take the first derivative, and set it to 0, P = 88. A firm’s sales grew from \\(\\$ 1,000\\) to \\(\\$ 1,500\\) from year one to year six. Express sales as an exponential function of time and determine the nominal rate of growth. Answer Since the sales of year 0 is 0, I set the exponential function as Sales = x1(1+r)^(t-1), where r means rate of growth. According to the prompt, 1500=1000(1+r)^5, thus r = 0.719. Find the price and quantity that will maximize total revenue, given the demand function \\(P=12.50 e^{-0.005} Q\\). Be sure to check the second-order condition. Answer Revenue = PQ = P((ln(P/12.5))/(-0.005)) take the first derivative, S=expression(P*((log(P/12.5))/(-0.005))) D(S, &#39;P&#39;) ## ((log(P/12.5))/(-0.005)) + P * (1/12.5/(P/12.5)/(-0.005)) =(log(P/12.5))/(-0.005))-200 take the second derivative, D(D(S, &#39;P&#39;),&#39;P&#39;) ## 1/12.5/(P/12.5)/(-0.005) + ((1/12.5/(P/12.5)/(-0.005)) - P * ## (1/12.5 * (1/12.5)/(P/12.5)^2/(-0.005))) N=expression((log(P/12.5))/(-0.005)-200) D(N, &#39;P&#39;) ## 1/12.5/(P/12.5)/(-0.005) =-200/P Since the second derivative is less than 0, the revenue is the maximum when the first dirivative is equal to 0, and then P=4.598493, and Q=200. 12.5*(exp(-1)) ## [1] 4.598493 "],["assignment-1.html", "Chapter 3 Assignment 1", " Chapter 3 Assignment 1 Question 1 Establish the shapes of the following sales response functions relating sales Y in units per period to advertising expenditure X ($ per period) Below function with a &gt; 0, b &gt; 0; Draw its graph.

(This is a short essay type question that should be brief – perhaps a couple of paragraphs - in less than a page.) (5 points) Tull et al (1986) examined the impact of excessive advertising on aggregate profits and sales under the assumptions of three types of response functions: diminishing returns, saturation, and quadratic sales. According to Tull et al (1986), although excessive advertising can compromise firms’ profits, the effect is subtle; Conversely, excessive advertising can increase sales. In other words, if a firm’s goal is to increase market share, the firm can keep investing in advertising to more than the optimal level at the subtle cost of profit loss. It is called “flat maximum principle”. Mantrala et al (1992) extended the model by adding marketing resource allocations to submarkets, such as geographic regions, market segments, and product segments. They also assume alternative sales response functions: concave saturation sales, S-shaped saturation sales, and quadratic sales. According to Mantrala et al (1992), investors have to consider investments and returns in the aggregate market and the proportions of investments and returns in the submarkets. They argue that Tull et al (1986) assumes the optimal resource applications in the submarkets, however, if the allocation is less optimal and the response function is concave saturation sales, the profits vary a lot, and the investment in advertising may increase tremendously to reach the same level of sales comparing to the optimal allocation level. In the S-shaped function, resource allocation can even change the parameters and the shape of the response function of the aggregate market. Further, they account for investors’ risk aversion levels, demonstrate different optimal investment choices by risk-averse and risk-neutral investors, and indicate profit variations.
